Hey!
We ([Elias/Northernside](https://northernsi.de) and me!) will hold a talk at the 39c3!
The talk will be streamed and available to be watched later in archives.
Check it out here in the [hub](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/event/detail/cuii-wie-konzerne-heimlich-webseiten-in-deutschland-sperren) or [fahrplan](https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2025/fahrplan/event/cuii-wie-konzerne-heimlich-webseiten-in-deutschland-sperren).

The talk itself is in German, but it will be translated (I guess?)

The talk will be about the CUII (which we already covered here multiple times: [1](/blog/exposing-the-cuii), [2](/blog/telefonica-sabotages-me) and [3](/blog/cuii-gives-up))  
There is some new information though in this talk and some new stuff that came up! So definitely come check it out if you're interested c:
